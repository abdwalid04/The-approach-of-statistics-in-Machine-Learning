    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\n",

    "Reducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\n",

    "\n",
    "More specifically, the reason why it is critical to perform standardization prior to PCA, is that the latter is quite sensitive regarding the variances of the initial variables. That is, if there are large differences between the ranges of initial variables, those variables with larger ranges will dominate over those with small ranges (for example, a variable that ranges between 0 and 100 will dominate over a variable that ranges between 0 and 1), which will lead to biased results. So, transforming the data to comparable scales can prevent this problem.\n",

    "The covariance matrix is a p × p symmetric matrix (where p is the number of dimensions) that has as entries the covariances associated with all possible pairs of the initial variables. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set with 3 variables x, y, and z, the covariance matrix is a 3×3 matrix of this from:\n",

    "## COMPUTE THE EIGENVECTORS AND EIGENVALUES OF THE COVARIANCE MATRIX TO IDENTIFY THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are the linear algebra concepts that we need to compute from the covariance matrix in order to determine the **principal components** of the data. Before getting to the explanation of these concepts, let’s first understand what do we mean by principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal components are new variables that are constructed as linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These combinations are done in such a way that the new variables (i.e., principal components) are uncorrelated and most of the information within the initial variables is squeezed or compressed into the first components. So, the idea is 10-dimensional data gives you 10 principal components, but PCA tries to put maximum possible information in the first component, then maximum remaining information in the second and so on, until having something like shown in the scree plot below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![caption](ReportFigures/Fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing information in principal components this way, will allow you to reduce dimensionality without losing much information, and this by discarding the components with low information and considering the remaining components as your new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to realize here is that the principal components are less interpretable and don’t have any real meaning since they are constructed as linear combinations of the initial variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically speaking, principal components represent the directions of the data that explain a **maximal amount of variance**, that is to say, the lines that capture most information of the data. The relationship between variance and information here, is that, the larger the variance carried by a line, the larger the dispersion of the data points along it, and the larger the dispersion along a line, the more information it has. To put all this simply, just think of principal components as new axes that provide the best angle to see and evaluate the data, so that the differences between the observations are better visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How PCA Constructs the Principal Components\n",
    "    \n",
    "As there are as many principal components as there are variables in the data, principal components are constructed in such a manner that the first principal component accounts for the **largest possible variance** in the data set. For example, let’s assume that the scatter plot of our data set is as shown below, can we guess the first principal component ? Yes, it’s approximately the line that matches the purple marks because it goes through the origin and it’s the line in which the projection of the points (red dots) is the most spread out. Or mathematically speaking, it’s the line that maximizes the variance (the average of the squared distances from the projected points (red dots) to the origin).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](ReportFigures/Fig2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second principal component is calculated in the same way, with the condition that it is uncorrelated with (i.e., perpendicular to) the first principal component and that it accounts for the next highest variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This continues until a total of p principal components have been calculated, equal to the original number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what we mean by principal components, let’s go back to eigenvectors and eigenvalues. What you first need to know about them is that they always come in pairs, so that every eigenvector has an eigenvalue. And their number is equal to the number of dimensions of the data. For example, for a 3-dimensional data set, there are 3 variables, therefore there are 3 eigenvectors with 3 corresponding eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, it is eigenvectors and eigenvalues who are behind all the magic explained above, because the eigenvectors of the Covariance matrix are actually the directions of the axes where there is the most variance(most information) and that we call Principal Components. And eigenvalues are simply the coefficients attached to eigenvectors, which give the amount of variance carried in each Principal Component.\n",
    "\n",
    "By ranking your eigenvectors in order of their eigenvalues, highest to lowest, you get the principal components in order of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose that our data set is 2-dimensional with 2 variables x,y and that the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "After having the principal components, to compute the percentage of variance (information) accounted for by each component, we divide the eigenvalue of each component by the sum of eigenvalues. If we apply this on the example above, we find that $PC_{1}$ and $PC_{2}$ carry respectively 97.4% and 2.6% of the variance of the data."

    "As we saw in the previous step, computing the eigenvectors and ordering them by their eigenvalues in descending order, allow us to find the principal components in order of significance. In this step, what we do is, to choose whether to keep all these components or discard those of lesser significance (of low eigenvalues), and form with the remaining ones a matrix of vectors that we call Feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the feature vector is simply a matrix that has as columns the eigenvectors of the components that we decide to keep. This makes it the first step towards dimensionality reduction, because if we choose to keep only $p$ eigenvectors (components) out of $n$, the final data set will have only $p$ dimensions.\n",

    "Discarding the eigenvector $v_{2}$ will reduce dimensionality by 1, and will consequently cause a loss of information in the final data set. But given that $v_{2}$ was carrying only 2.6% of the information, the loss will be therefore not important and we will still have 97.4% of the information that is carried by $v_{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as we saw in the example, it’s up to you to choose whether to keep all the components or discard the ones of lesser significance, depending on what you are looking for. Because if you just want to describe your data in terms of new variables (principal components) that are uncorrelated without seeking to reduce dimensionality, leaving out lesser significant components is not needed."
